Conquest
========

Dart port of a very old game found on an Amiga Fish disk.

To start (using Dart 2.12 or later):

    dart run

For documentation see [Fish Disk 24](https://aminet.net/package/misc/fish/fish-0024) â€“ or look at the source code. The dart source, BTW, is a more or less direct port of the original C source which was clearly ported from some other language. I cleaned it up a little bit but part of the charm of this old piece of software is the archaic style.
